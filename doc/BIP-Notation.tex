        \item $\braced*{a\text{:}b}=\setopen i\setwhere i\in\bracketed*{a,b}\setclose$ : interval of indices
        \item $A_{*, j}$ : Column vector composed of all $*=1\text{:}m$ rows of the $j$-th column of the matrix $A$
        \item $A_{i, *}$ : Row vector composed of all $*=1\text{:}n$ columns of the $i$-th row of the matrix $A$
        \item $A_{\braced*{a\text{:}b}, j}$%

        \item $\mathbickx{I}%

             : the sequentially ordered set of all proton history indices
        \item $\mathbickx{B}_{(k)}%
            =\braced*{1, 2, 3, \cdots, B_{(k)}}$%
             : the sequentially ordered set of all BIP block indices, where the \# of BIP blocks $B_{(k)}$ may vary as a function of iteration $k$.

             : function $f_{(k)}$ assigning one of the $B_{(k)}$ BIP block indices to each of the $m$ proton historie indices, thereby setting the \# of histories and the order they are processed within each block as well as the order that these blocks of histories are processed in the $k$-th iteration.  This function may be varied as a function of iteration $k$, permitting the user to assign different BIP block configurations and/or history ordering schemes.

            : the ordered family of sets of BIP blocks of proton history indices for iteration $k$, assigned according to the function $f_{(k)}$
        \item $H_i=\setopen x\in\mathbbm{R}^n \setwhere \angled*{A_{i, *}, x} = b_i, i\in\mathbickx{I}\setclose$%
