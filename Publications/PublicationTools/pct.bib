    ABSTRACT =      {Proton computed tomography (pCT) has been explored in the past decades because of its unique imaging characteristics, low radiation dose, and its possible use for treatment planning and on-line target localization in proton therapy. However, reconstruction of pCT images is challenging because the proton path within the object to be imaged is statistically affected by multiple Coulomb scattering. In this paper, we employ GEANT4-based Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional pCT reconstruction of an elliptical phantom to investigate the possible use of the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) with three different path-estimation methods for pCT reconstruction. The first method assumes a straight-line path (SLP) connecting the proton entry and exit positions, the second method adapts the most-likely path (MLP) theoretically determined for a uniform medium, and the third method employs a cubic spline path (CSP). The ART reconstructions showed progressive improvement of spatial resolution when going from the SLP [2 line pairs (lp) ] to the curved CSP and MLP path estimates . The MLP-based ART algorithm had the fastest convergence and smallest residual error of all three estimates. This work demonstrates the advantage of tracking curved proton paths in conjunction with the ART algorithm and curved path estimates.},

    ABSTRACT =      {This paper reports on the activity of the INFN PRIMA/RDH collaboration in the development of proton Computed Tomography (p{CT}) systems based on single proton tracking and residual energy measurement. The systems are made of a silicon microstrip tracker and a YAG:Ce crystal calorimeter to measure single protons trajectory and residual energy, respectively. A first prototype of p{CT} scanner, with an active area of about 5 × 5 cm 2 and a data rate capability of 10 kHz, has been constructed and characterized with 62 MeV protons at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in Catania (Italy) and with 180 MeV protons at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL) in Uppsala (Sweden). Results of these measurements, including tomographic reconstructions of test phantoms, will be shown and discussed. An upgraded system with an extended field of view (up to ~ 5 × 20 cm 2 ) and an increased event rate capability up to one MHz, presently under development, will be also described.}

    ABSTRACT =      {A desktop vision system is presented for complete 3D model acquisition. It is fast, low-cost, and accurate. Partial 3D shapes and texture information are acquired from multiple viewing directions using rotational stereo and shape from focus (SFF). The resulting range images are registered to a common coordinate system and a surface representation is created for each range image. The resulting surfaces are integrated using a new algorithm named Region-of-Construction. Unlike previous approaches, the Region-of-Construction algorithm directly exploits the structure of the raw range images. The algorithm determines regions in range images corresponding to non-redundant surfaces which can be stitched along the boundaries to construct the complete 3D surface model. The algorithm is computationally efficient and less sensitive to registration error. It also has the ability to construct complete 3D models of complex objects with holes. A photo realistic 3D model is obtained by mapping texture information onto the complete surface model representing 3D shape. Experimental results for several real objects are presented.},

    ABSTRACT =      {Image reconstruction from projections suffers from an inherent difficulty: there are different images that have identical projections in any finite number of directions. However, by identifying the type of image that is likely to occur in an application area, one can design algorithms that may be efficacious in that area even when the number of projections is small. One such approach uses total variation minimization. We report on an algorithm based on this approach, and show that sometimes it produces medically-desirable reconstructions in computerized tomography ({CT}) even from a small number of projections. However, we also demonstrate that such a reconstruction is not guaranteed to provide the medically-relevant information: when data are collected by an actual {CT} scanner for a small number of projections, the noise in such data may very well result in a tumor in the brain not being visible in the reconstruction.}

    ABSTRACT =      {This is a review paper on some of the physics, modeling, and iterative algorithms in proton computed tomography ({pCT}) image reconstruction. The primary challenge in p{CT} image reconstruction lies in the degraded spatial resolution resulting from multiple Coulomb scattering within the imaged object. Analytical models such as the most likely path have been proposed to predict the scattered trajectory from measurements of individual proton location and direction before and after the object. Iterative algorithms provide a flexible tool with which to incorporate these models into image reconstruction. The modeling leads to a large and sparse linear system of equations that can efficiently be solved by projection methods-based iterative algorithms. Such algorithms perform projections of the iterates onto the hyperlanes that are represented by the linear equations of the system. They perform these projections in possibly various algorithmic structures, such as block-iterative projections, string-averaging projections. These algorithmic schemes allow flexibility of choosing blocks, strings, and other parameters. They also cater for parallel implementations which are apt to further save clock time in computations. Experimental results are presented which compare some of those algorithmic options.},

Reconstructed tomography images with density resolutions r.m.s. down to $\sim$1\% and spatial resolutions <1mm, achieved within processing times of $\sim$15′ for a $512\times 512$ pixels image prove that this technique will be beneficial if used instead of {X-CT} in hadron-therapy.}

    ABSTRACT =      {Proton computed tomography ({pCT}) is an evolving tomographic imaging modality with applications in proton and ion therapy. The method allows direct reconstruction of relative stopping power of patient tissues in a 3D-fashion. The {pCT} collaboration has built first experimental prototypes of {pCT} scanning systems [1] and has developed approaches to reconstruct proton {CT} images based on registering the coordinates and water equivalent path length (WEPL) of individual protons traversing the scanned volume. From these data one reconstructs the object boundary (hull) and initial image based on filtered back projection (FBP), calculates a most likely path (MLP) for each proton, and improves the initial image iteratively by solving a large linear system of equations of the form Ax = b using an iterative projection algorithm [2].},

    ABSTRACT =      {The use of hadron beams, especially proton beams, in cancer radiotherapy has expanded rapidly in the past two decades. To fully realize the advantages of hadron therapy over traditional x-ray and gamma-ray therapy requires accurate positioning of the Bragg peak throughout the tumor being treated. A half century ago, suggestions had already been made to use protons themselves to develop images of tumors and surrounding tissue, to be used for treatment planning. The recent global expansion of hadron therapy, coupled with modern advances in computation and particle detection, has led several collaborations around the world to develop prototype detector systems and associated reconstruction codes for proton computed tomography (p{CT}), as well as more simple proton radiography, with the ultimate intent to use such systems in clinical treatment planning and verification. Recent imaging results of phantoms in hospital proton beams are encouraging, but many technical and programmatic challenges remain to be overcome before p{CT} scanners will be introduced into clinics. This review introduces hadron therapy and the perceived advantages of p{CT} and proton radiography for treatment planning, reviews its historical development, and discusses the physics related to proton imaging, the associated experimental and computation issues, the technologies used to attack the problem, contemporary efforts in detector and computational development, and the current status and outlook.}

This resilience can be used to steer the iterative process towards a feasible point that is superior in the sense of some functional on the points in the Euclidean space having a small value. The potential usefulness of this is illustrated in image reconstruction from projections, using both total variation and negative entropy as the functional.}

    ABSTRACT =      {The projected subgradient method for constrained minimization repeatedly interlaces subgradient steps for the objective function with projections onto the feasible region, which is the intersection of closed and convex constraints sets, to regain feasibility. The latter poses a computational difficulty, and, therefore, the projected subgradient method is applicable only when the feasible region is ``simple to project onto.'' In contrast to this, in the superiorization methodology a feasibility-seeking algorithm leads the overall process, and objective function steps are interlaced into it. This makes a difference because the feasibility-seeking algorithm employs projections onto the individual constraints sets and not onto the entire feasible region.},

    ABSTRACT =      {Linear superiorization (LinSup) considers linear programming problems but instead of attempting to solve them with linear optimization methods it employs perturbation resilient feasibility-seeking algorithms and steers them toward reduced (not necessarily minimal) target function values. The two questions that we set out to explore experimentally are: (i) does LinSup provide a feasible point whose linear target function value is lower than that obtained by running the same feasibility-seeking algorithm without superiorization under identical conditions? (ii) How does LinSup fare in comparison with the Simplex method for solving linear programming problems? Based on our computational experiments presented here, the answers to these two questions are: -yes- and -very well-, respectively.}

    ABSTRACT =      {Recent work in {CT} image reconstruction has seen increasing interest in the use of total variation (TV) and related penalties to regularize problems involving reconstruction from undersampled or incomplete data. Superiorization is a recently proposed heuristic which provides an automatic procedure to -superiorize- an iterative image reconstruction algorithm with respect to a chosen objective function, such as TV. Under certain conditions, the superiorized algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is as satisfactory as any found by the original algorithm with respect to satisfying the constraints of the problem; this solution is also expected to be superior with respect to the chosen objective. Most work on superiorization has used reconstruction algorithms which assume a linear measurement model, which in the case of {CT} corresponds to data generated from a monoenergetic x-ray beam. Many {CT} systems generate x-rays from a polyenergetic spectrum, however, in which the measured data represent an integral of object attenuation over all energies in the spectrum. This inconsistency with the linear model produces the well-known beam hardening artifacts, which impair analysis of {CT} images. In this work we superiorize an iterative algorithm for reconstruction from polyenergetic data, using both TV and an anisotropic TV (ATV) penalty. We apply the superiorized algorithm in numerical phantom experiments modeling both sparse-view and limited-angle scenarios. In our experiments, the superiorized algorithm successfully finds solutions which are as constraints-compatible as those found by the original algorithm, with significantly reduced TV and ATV values. The superiorized algorithm thus produces images with greatly reduced sparse-view and limited angle artifacts, which are also largely free of the beam hardening artifacts that would be present if a superiorized version of a monoenergetic algorithm were used.}

    ABSTRACT =      {To reduce the x-ray dose in computerized tomography ({CT}), many constrained optimization approaches have been proposed aiming at minimizing a regularizing function that measures a lack of consistency with some prior knowledge about the object that is being imaged, subject to a (predetermined) level of consistency with the detected attenuation of x-rays. One commonly investigated regularizing function is total variation (TV), while other publications advocate the use of some type of multiscale geometric transform in the definition of the regularizing function, a particular recent choice for this is the shearlet transform. Proponents of the shearlet transform in the regularizing function claim that the reconstructions so obtained are better than those produced using TV for texture preservation (but may be worse for noise reduction). In this paper we report results related to this claim. In our reported experiments using simulated {CT} data collection of the head, reconstructions whose shearlet transform has a small $\ell_1$-norm are not more efficacious than reconstructions that have a small TV value. Our experiments for making such comparisons use the recently-developed superiorization methodology for both regularizing functions. Superiorization is an automated procedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy a primary criterion (such as consistency with the observed measurements) into its superiorized version that will produce results that, according to the primary criterion are as good as those produced by the original algorithm, but in addition are superior to them according to a secondary (regularizing) criterion. The method presented for superiorization involving the $\ell_1$-norm of the shearlet transform is novel and is quite general: It can be used for any regularizing function that is defined as the $\ell_1$-norm of a transform specified by the application of a matrix. Because in the previous literature the split Bregman algorithm is used for similar purposes, a section is included comparing the results of the superiorization algorithm with the split Bregman algorithm.}

In this paper, we propose a superiorized version of the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) based on the PRISM model. Then, we compare the proposed superiorized algorithm with the Split-Bregman algorithm in numerical experiments. The results show that both the Superiorized-SART and the Split-Bregman algorithms generate good results with weak noise and reduced artefacts.}

Discontinuities in either density or chemical composition, or both, seem to cause artifacts in the reconstruction. These may be related to the West-Sherwood effect.}

    ABSTRACT =      {This simulation study presents the application of fluence field modulated computed tomography, initially developed for x-ray {CT}, to proton computed tomography (p{CT}). By using pencil beam (PB) scanning, fluence modulated p{CT} (FMp{CT}) may achieve variable image quality in a p{CT} image and imaging dose reduction. Three virtual phantoms, a uniform cylinder and two patients, were studied using Monte Carlo simulations of an ideal list-mode p{CT} scanner. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected for high image quality and only PBs intercepting them preserved full fluence (FF). Image quality was investigated in terms of accuracy (mean) and noise (standard deviation) of the reconstructed proton relative stopping power compared to reference values. Dose calculation accuracy on FMp{CT} images was evaluated in terms of dose volume histograms (DVH), range difference (RD) for beam-eye-view (BEV) dose profiles and gamma evaluation. Pseudo FMp{CT} scans were created from broad beam experimental data acquired with a list-mode p{CT} prototype. FMp{CT} noise in ROIs was equivalent to FF images and accuracy better than-1.3\%(-0.7\%) by using 1\% of FF for the cylinder (patients). Integral imaging dose reduction of 37\% and 56\% was achieved for the two patients for that level of modulation. Corresponding DVHs from proton dose calculation on FMp{CT} images agreed to those from reference images and 96\% of BEV profiles had RD below 2mm, compared to only 1\% for uniform 1\% of FF. Gamma pass rates (2\%, 2mm) were 98\% for FMp{CT} while for uniform 1\% of FF they were as low as 59\%. Applying FMp{CT} to preliminary experimental data showed that low noise levels and accuracy could be preserved in a ROI, down to 30\% modulation. We have shown, using both virtual and experimental p{CT} scans, that FMp{CT} is potentially feasible and may allow a means of imaging dose reduction for a p{CT} scanner operating in PB scanning mode. This may be of particular importance to proton therapy given the low integral dose found outside the target.}

    ABSTRACT =      {The GEANT4 {Monte Carlo} code provides many powerful functions for conducting particle transport simulations with great reliability and flexibility. However, as a general purpose {Monte Carlo} code, not all the functions were specifically designed and fully optimized for applications in radiation therapy. One of the primary issues is the computational efficiency, which is especially critical when patient {{CT}} data have to be imported into the simulation model. In this paper we summarize the relevant aspects of the GEANT4 tracking and geometry algorithms and introduce our work on using the code to conduct dose calculations based on {CT} data. The emphasis is focused on modifications of the GEANT4 source code to meet the requirements for fast dose calculations. The major features include a quick voxel search algorithm, fast volume optimization, and the dynamic assignment of material density. These features are ready to be used for tracking the primary types of particles employed in radiation therapy such as photons, electrons, and heavy charged particles. Re-calculation of a proton therapy treatment plan generated by a commercial treatment planning program for a paranasal sinus case is presented as an example.}

    ABSTRACT =      {Proton Computed Tomography (p{CT}) is a medical imaging method with a potential for increasing accuracy of treatment planning and patient positioning in hadron therapy. A p{CT} system based on a Silicon microstrip tracker and a YAG:Ce crystal calorimeter has been developed within the INFN Prima-RDH collaboration. The prototype has been tested with a 175 MeV proton beam at The Svedberg Laboratory (Uppsala, Sweden) with the aim to reconstruct and characterize a tomographic image. Algebraic iterative reconstruction methods (ART), together with the most likely path formalism, have been used to obtain tomographies of an inhomogeneous phantom to eventually extract density and spatial resolutions. These results will be presented and discussed together with an estimation of the average dose delivered to the phantom and the dependence of the image quality on the dose. Due to the heavy computation load required by the algebraic algorithms the reconstruction programs have been implemented to fully exploit the high calculation parallelism of Graphics Processing Units. An extended field of view p{CT} system is in an advanced construction stage. This apparatus will be able to reconstruct objects of the size of a human head making possible to characterize this p{CT} approach in a pre-clinical environment.}

    ABSTRACT =      {Image-guided radiotherapy has an established role in all forms of radiotherapy treatment delivery. Proton therapy seeks to deliver superior dose distributions through utilising the Bragg peak to target tumour and avoid sensitive normal tissue. The Bragg peak and sharp falloff in dose delivered by proton therapy necessitate careful treatment planning and treatment delivery. The dose distribution delivered by proton therapy is particularly sensitive to uncertainty in the prediction of proton range during treatment planning and deviations from the planned delivery during the course of the fractionated treatment. Realising the superior dose distribution of proton therapy requires increased diligence and image guidance has a key role in ensuring that treatments are planned and delivered. This article will outline the current status of image guidance for proton therapy, particularly highlighting differences with regard to high-energy X-ray therapy, and will look at a number of future improvements in image-guided proton therapy.}

    ABSTRACT =      {Proton radiography is investigated for its use as a quality control tool in proton therapy. Images were produced both with range and range uncertainty information of protons passing through phantoms (Alderson phantom and a sheep's head). With the range images the correct positioning of the patient with respect to the beam could be verified. The range uncertainty images were used to quantitatively detect range variations of protons passing through inhomogeneities in the patient. These measurements can be used to indicate critical situations during proton therapy or to determine the safety margin around the tumor volume. With the range information the precision of different calibrations of computer tomography Hounsfield values to relative proton stopping power, used for proton treatment planning, was determined. It is found that the precision in range can be improved by a detailed analysis of the calibration data obtained from tissue-substitute measurements, by a factor of 2.5. The resulting range errors are in the order of the positioning precision (1 mm).},

    ABSTRACT =      {Proton radiography and tomography have long promised benefit for proton therapy. Their first suggestion was in the early 1960s and the first published proton radiographs and CT images appeared in the late 1960s and 1970s, respectively. More than just providing anatomical images, proton transmission imaging provides the potential for the more accurate estimation of stopping-power ratio inside a patient and hence improved treatment planning and verification. With the recent explosion in growth of clinical proton therapy facilities, the time is perhaps ripe for the imaging modality to come to the fore. Yet many technical challenges remain to be solved before proton CT scanners become commonplace in the clinic. Research and development in this field is currently more active than at any time with several prototype designs emerging. This review introduces the principles of proton radiography and tomography, their historical developments, the raft of modern prototype systems and the primary design issues. },

The scheme, employing Bregman projections, is analyzed with the aid of an extended product space formalism. For the case of orthogonal projections we give also a relaxed version. Along with the well-known purely sequential and fully simultaneous cases, the new scheme includes many other inherently parallel algorithmic options depending on the choice of strings. Convergence in the consistent case is proven and an application to optimization over linear inequalities is given. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

    ABSTRACT =      {Purpose: Proton {CT} ({pCT}) has the potential to accurately measure the electron density map of tissues at low doses but the spatial resolution is prohibitive if the curved paths of protons in matter is not accounted for. The authors propose to account for an estimate of the most likely path of protons in a filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm. Methods: The energy loss of protons is first binned in several proton radiographs at different distances to the proton source to exploit the depth-dependency of the estimate of the most likely path. This process is named the distance-driven binning. A voxel-specific backprojection is then used to select the adequate radiograph in the distance-driven binning in order to propagate in the pCT image the best achievable spatial resolution in proton radiographs. The improvement in spatial resolution is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations of resolution phantoms. Results: The spatial resolution in the distance-driven binning depended on the distance of the objects from the source and was optimal in the binned radiograph corresponding to that distance. The spatial resolution in the reconstructed pCT images decreased with the depth in the scanned object but it was always better than previous FBP algorithms assuming straight line paths. In a water cylinder with 20 cm diameter, the observed range of spatial resolutions was 0.7 − 1.6 mm compared to 1.0 − 2.4 mm at best with a straight line path assumption. The improvement was strongly enhanced in shorter 200° scans. Conclusions: Improved spatial resolution was obtained in pCT images with filtered backprojection reconstruction using most likely path estimates of protons. The improvement in spatial resolution combined with the practicality of FBP algorithms compared to iterative reconstruction algorithms makes this new algorithm a candidate of choice for clinical pCT.}

    ABSTRACT =      {Previous work has shown that total variation superiorization (TVS) improves reconstructed image quality in proton computed tomography (pCT). The structure of the TVS algorithm has evolved since then and this paper investigated if this new algorithmic structure provides additional benefits to pCT image quality. Structural and parametric changes introduced to the original TVS algorithm included: (1) inclusion or exclusion of TV reduction requirement, (2) a variable number, N , of TV perturbation steps per feasibility-seeking iteration, and (3) introduction of a perturbation kernel 0< $\alpha$ < 1. The structural change of excluding the TV reduction requirement check tended to have a beneficial effect for 3≤ N≤ 6 and allows full parallelization of the TVS algorithm. Repeated perturbations per feasibility-seeking iterations reduced total variation (TV) and material dependent standard deviations for 3≤ N≤ 6. The perturbation kernel $\alpha$ , effectively equal to $\alpha$ =0.5 in the original TVS algorithm, reduced TV and standard deviations as $\alpha$ was increased beyond $\alpha$ =0.5 , but negatively impacted reconstructed relative stopping power (RSP) values for $\alpha$ >0.75. The reductions in TV and standard deviations allowed feasibility-seeking with a larger relaxation parameter $\lambda$than previously used, without the corresponding increases in standard deviations experienced with the original TVS algorithm. This paper demonstrates that the modifications related to the evolution of the original TVS algorithm provide benefits in terms of both pCT image quality and computational efficiency for appropriately chosen parameter values.},

    ABSTRACT =      {We have measured multiple Coulomb scattering of 158.6 MeV protons in fourteen materials from beryllium to uranium including brass and several plastics. Targets ranged from thin (negligible energy loss) to very thick (greater than the mean proton range). The angular distribution was measured by means of a single diode dosimeter scanned typically over two decades of dose falloff. Each data set was fitted with a Molière scattering distribution (using Bethe's tables) to extract a characteristic angle θM as well as a Gaussian distribution to extract a characteristic angle θ0. As expected in the small angle region, the Gaussian fits about as well as the Molière shape. The θM values were compared with Molière's predicted value (χcB2) including Fano's correction for scattering by atomic electrons and using Molière's formalism to account for energy loss and/or compound targets or mixtures. The distribution of the deviation from theory for 115 independent measurements is approximately normal, with a mean value − 0.5 ± 0.4\% and an rms spread of 5\%. The $θ_0$ values were compared with Highland's formula and with an “improved Highland” formula of Lynch and Dahl, using our own generalization to thick targets. The overall accuracy of Highland's formula is slightly worse than that of Molière theory. The distribution of the deviation from theory for 115 independent measurements is normal, with a mean value − 2.6 ± 0.5\% and an rms spread of 6\%. The Lynch formula gives nearly the same average statistics though details of the fit are different. Some data were taken for very thick targets (thickness greater than 97\% of the mean proton range) where only a fraction of the incident protons emerge. Here the characteristic angle appears to level off or even to fall slightly with target thickness perhaps due to the filtering out of large-angle protons. These measurements are presented but were excluded from the comparison with theory. We have reviewed six other published proton measurements, partially reanalyzing four whose authors claimed that Molière theory either did not apply (because of thick targets) or was incorrect. These experiments range from 1 MeV to 200 GeV incident energy. Averaging each measurement including our own over everything but target material we obtain 39 independent measurements of the deviation from theory whose distribution is normal with a mean value − 0.3 ± 0.5\% and an rms spread of 3\%. We conclude that Molière theory with the Fano correction is accurate to better than 1\% on the average for protons. Systematic discrepancies on the order of a few percent with target thickness and/or target material cannot be ruled out at present. In particular there is some indication that the theory may be  $\apprx 4\%$ high for the highest-Z materials.}
