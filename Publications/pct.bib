  abstract={This paper reports on the activity of the INFN PRIMA/RDH collaboration in the development of proton Computed Tomography (pCT) systems based on single proton tracking and residual energy measurement. The systems are made of a silicon microstrip tracker and a YAG:Ce crystal calorimeter to measure single protons trajectory and residual energy, respectively. A first prototype of pCT scanner, with an active area of about 5 Ã 5 cm 2 and a data rate capability of 10 kHz, has been constructed and characterized with 62 MeV protons at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in Catania (Italy) and with 180 MeV protons at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL) in Uppsala (Sweden). Results of these measurements, including tomographic reconstructions of test phantoms, will be shown and discussed. An upgraded system with an extended field of view (up to ~ 5 Ã 20 cm 2 ) and an increased event rate capability up to one MHz, presently under development, will be also described.}

  abstract={Image reconstruction from projections suffers from an inherent difficulty: there are different images that have identical projections in any finite number of directions. However, by identifying the type of image that is likely to occur in an application area, one can design algorithms that may be efficacious in that area even when the number of projections is small. One such approach uses total variation minimization. We report on an algorithm based on this approach, and show that sometimes it produces medically-desirable reconstructions in computerized tomography (CT) even from a small number of projections. However, we also demonstrate that such a reconstruction is not guaranteed to provide the medically-relevant information: when data are collected by an actual CT scanner for a small number of projections, the noise in such data may very well result in a tumor in the brain not being visible in the reconstruction.}

abstract="This is a review paper on some of the physics, modeling, and iterative algorithms in proton computed tomography ({pCT}) image reconstruction. The primary challenge in pCT image reconstruction lies in the degraded spatial resolution resulting from multiple Coulomb scattering within the imaged object. Analytical models such as the most likely path have been proposed to predict the scattered trajectory from measurements of individual proton location and direction before and after the object. Iterative algorithms provide a flexible tool with which to incorporate these models into image reconstruction. The modeling leads to a large and sparse linear system of equations that can efficiently be solved by projection methods-based iterative algorithms. Such algorithms perform projections of the iterates onto the hyperlanes that are represented by the linear equations of the system. They perform these projections in possibly various algorithmic structures, such as block-iterative projections, string-averaging projections. These algorithmic schemes allow flexibility of choosing blocks, strings, and other parameters. They also cater for parallel implementations which are apt to further save clock time in computations. Experimental results are presented which compare some of those algorithmic options.",

The method allows direct reconstruction of relative stopping power of patient tissues in a 3D-fashion. The {pCT} collaboration has built first experimental prototypes of {pCT} scanning systems [1] and has developed approaches to reconstruct proton {CT} images based on registering the coordinates and water equivalent path length (WEPL) of individual protons traversing the scanned volume. From these data one reconstructs the object boundary (hull) and initial image based on filtered back projection (FBP), calculates a most likely path (MLP) for each proton, and improves the initial image iteratively by solving a large linear system of equations of the form Ax = b using an iterative projection algorithm [2].},

  abstract={The use of hadron beams, especially proton beams, in cancer radiotherapy has expanded rapidly in the past two decades. To fully realize the advantages of hadron therapy over traditional x-ray and gamma-ray therapy requires accurate positioning of the Bragg peak throughout the tumor being treated. A half century ago, suggestions had already been made to use protons themselves to develop images of tumors and surrounding tissue, to be used for treatment planning. The recent global expansion of hadron therapy, coupled with modern advances in computation and particle detection, has led several collaborations around the world to develop prototype detector systems and associated reconstruction codes for proton computed tomography (pCT), as well as more simple proton radiography, with the ultimate intent to use such systems in clinical treatment planning and verification. Recent imaging results of phantoms in hospital proton beams are encouraging, but many technical and programmatic challenges remain to be overcome before pCT scanners will be introduced into clinics. This review introduces hadron therapy and the perceived advantages of pCT and proton radiography for treatment planning, reviews its historical development, and discusses the physics related to proton imaging, the associated experimental and computation issues, the technologies used to attack the problem, contemporary efforts in detector and computational development, and the current status and outlook.}

The latter poses a computational difficulty, and, therefore, the projected subgradient method is applicable only when the feasible region is ``simple to project onto.'' In contrast to this, in the superiorization methodology a feasibility-seeking algorithm leads the overall process, and objective function steps are interlaced into it. This makes a difference because the feasibility-seeking algorithm employs projections onto the individual constraints sets and not onto the entire feasible region.",

(ii) How does LinSup fare in comparison with the Simplex method for solving linear programming problems? Based on our computational experiments presented here, the answers to these two questions are: -yes- and -very well-, respectively.}

  abstract={Recent work in CT image reconstruction has seen increasing interest in the use of total variation (TV) and related penalties to regularize problems involving reconstruction from undersampled or incomplete data. Superiorization is a recently proposed heuristic which provides an automatic procedure to -superiorize- an iterative image reconstruction algorithm with respect to a chosen objective function, such as TV. Under certain conditions, the superiorized algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is as satisfactory as any found by the original algorithm with respect to satisfying the constraints of the problem; this solution is also expected to be superior with respect to the chosen objective. Most work on superiorization has used reconstruction algorithms which assume a linear measurement model, which in the case of CT corresponds to data generated from a monoenergetic x-ray beam. Many CT systems generate x-rays from a polyenergetic spectrum, however, in which the measured data represent an integral of object attenuation over all energies in the spectrum. This inconsistency with the linear model produces the well-known beam hardening artifacts, which impair analysis of CT images. In this work we superiorize an iterative algorithm for reconstruction from polyenergetic data, using both TV and an anisotropic TV (ATV) penalty. We apply the superiorized algorithm in numerical phantom experiments modeling both sparse-view and limited-angle scenarios. In our experiments, the superiorized algorithm successfully finds solutions which are as constraints-compatible as those found by the original algorithm, with significantly reduced TV and ATV values. The superiorized algorithm thus produces images with greatly reduced sparse-view and limited angle artifacts, which are also largely free of the beam hardening artifacts that would be present if a superiorized version of a monoenergetic algorithm were used.}

  abstract={To reduce the x-ray dose in computerized tomography (CT), many constrained optimization approaches have been proposed aiming at minimizing a regularizing function that measures a lack of consistency with some prior knowledge about the object that is being imaged, subject to a (predetermined) level of consistency with the detected attenuation of x-rays. One commonly investigated regularizing function is total variation (TV), while other publications advocate the use of some type of multiscale geometric transform in the definition of the regularizing function, a particular recent choice for this is the shearlet transform. Proponents of the shearlet transform in the regularizing function claim that the reconstructions so obtained are better than those produced using TV for texture preservation (but may be worse for noise reduction). In this paper we report results related to this claim. In our reported experiments using simulated CT data collection of the head, reconstructions whose shearlet transform has a small $\ell_1$-norm are not more efficacious than reconstructions that have a small TV value. Our experiments for making such comparisons use the recently-developed superiorization methodology for both regularizing functions. Superiorization is an automated procedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy a primary criterion (such as consistency with the observed measurements) into its superiorized version that will produce results that, according to the primary criterion are as good as those produced by the original algorithm, but in addition are superior to them according to a secondary (regularizing) criterion. The method presented for superiorization involving the $\ell_1$-norm of the shearlet transform is novel and is quite general: It can be used for any regularizing function that is defined as the $\ell_1$-norm of a transform specified by the application of a matrix. Because in the previous literature the split Bregman algorithm is used for similar purposes, a section is included comparing the results of the superiorization algorithm with the split Bregman algorithm.}

abstract = {The GEANT4 Monte Carlo code provides many powerful functions for conducting particle transport simulations with great reliability and flexibility. However, as a general purpose Monte Carlo code, not all the functions were specifically designed and fully optimized for applications in radiation therapy. One of the primary issues is the computational efficiency, which is especially critical when patient CT data have to be imported into the simulation model. In this paper we summarize the relevant aspects of the GEANT4 tracking and geometry algorithms and introduce our work on using the code to conduct dose calculations based on CT data. The emphasis is focused on modifications of the GEANT4 source code to meet the requirements for fast dose calculations. The major features include a quick voxel search algorithm, fast volume optimization, and the dynamic assignment of material density. These features are ready to be used for tracking the primary types of particles employed in radiation therapy such as photons, electrons, and heavy charged particles. Re-calculation of a proton therapy treatment plan generated by a commercial treatment planning program for a paranasal sinus case is presented as an example.}

  abstract={Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) is a medical imaging method with a potential for increasing accuracy of treatment planning and patient positioning in hadron therapy. A pCT system based on a Silicon microstrip tracker and a YAG:Ce crystal calorimeter has been developed within the INFN Prima-RDH collaboration. The prototype has been tested with a 175 MeV proton beam at The Svedberg Laboratory (Uppsala, Sweden) with the aim to reconstruct and characterize a tomographic image. Algebraic iterative reconstruction methods (ART), together with the most likely path formalism, have been used to obtain tomographies of an inhomogeneous phantom to eventually extract density and spatial resolutions. These results will be presented and discussed together with an estimation of the average dose delivered to the phantom and the dependence of the image quality on the dose. Due to the heavy computation load required by the algebraic algorithms the reconstruction programs have been implemented to fully exploit the high calculation parallelism of Graphics Processing Units. An extended field of view pCT system is in an advanced construction stage. This apparatus will be able to reconstruct objects of the size of a human head making possible to characterize this pCT approach in a pre-clinical environment.}

Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science.",
