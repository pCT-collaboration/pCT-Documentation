\begin{tcbparbox}|\dirsep local\dirsep$\dots$|%
    \bfdash This is the parent directory for all pCT code and data on each Tardis compute node's local solid-state drive, the equivalent of the \docentry[constdir]{ion} directory on Kodiak's network attached storage device.  This data is stored on the compute nodes' local solid-state drive and is not backed up, so users must ensure they copy data to Kodiak if they want to store it permanently

\begin{tcbparbox}|\dirsep local\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep $\dots$|
\bfdash This directory is used to store pCT code on the Tardis compute nodes and corresponds to the \docentry[constdir]{ion\dirsep pCT\_code} directory on Kodiak (with the same organizatioal scheme as well).

\begin{tcbparbox}%
     |\dirsep local\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep user\_code\dirsep\caratenclosed*{username}\dirsep$\dots$|
\bfdash The equivalent of Kodiak's \docentry[constdir]{ion\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep user\_code\dirsep\caratenclosed*{username}\dirsep$\dots$} subdirectories where pCT users can copy/modify/execute their personal clones of pCT program repositories and their personal code on Tardis compute nodes

\begin{tcbparbox}|\dirsep local\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep git\dirsep\caratenclosed*{GitHub account}\dirsep\caratenclosed*{GitHub repository}\dirsep $\dots$|
\bfdash This directory contains clones of the available pCT GitHub accounts and repositories, with parent directories for each GitHub account and subdirectories for each of their repositories.  Each program repository has a \docentry[gitbranch]{master} branch, which typically corresponds to the current release version (though there may also be a branch like \docentry[gitbranch]{release} used instead) and each of the program's developers will typically have their own branch which they can use to develop and test new ideas/features.  The group of developers of a program should decide amongst themselves what the process will be for approving merges with the \docentry[gitbranch]{master/release} branch and when to release a new version of the program, which may include the results of several separate merges.\\\par

Users accessing the \docentry[gitbranch]{master/release} branch of these clones should execute \tcbinlinebashbox!{git pull --rebase} prior to using the code to ensure it is updated to its latest version.\\\par

\textbf{\ul{NOTE}: This should not be done for other branches or the personal versions of code}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparbox}|\dirsep local\dirsep pCT\_data\dirsep$\dots$|
\bfdash This directory is where pCT data is to be copied from Kodiak and corresponds to the \docentry[constdir]{ion\dirsep pCT\_data} directory on Kodiak.
\end{tcbparbox}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparbox}|\dirsep local\dirsep pCT\_data\dirsep user\_data\dirsep\caratenclosed*{username}\dirsep$\dots$|
\bfdash Subdirectories for each pCT user on each Tardis compute node where they can transfer data they want to reconstruct when the data is not organized according to the pCT data naming/organizational scheme.  If the output data they generate will also be unorganized, it should also be written to this directory.\\\par

\textbf{\ul{NOTE}: The \docentry[gitrepo]{pCT-collaboration/pCT\_Tools} repository contains a script which loads a number of bash functions useful to pCT users, including a function that can be used to organize and then copy unorganized data to the organized data directory on the Tardis compute nodes}
