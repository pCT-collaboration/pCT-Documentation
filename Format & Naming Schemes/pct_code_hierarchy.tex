\bfdash directory on Kodiak and each Tardis compute node used to store clones of the GitHub repositories relevant to pCT and the private storage of user code.  The naming and organizational scheme is the same on Kodiak and each Tardis compute node, thereby simplifying distribution of code for execution on Tardis; the only difference is the top level parent directory on Kodiak is \docentry[constdir]{ion} and on the Tardis compute nodes it is \docentry[constdir]{local}, but their subdirectories are identical.  See the \autohyperlink[type=Section]{GitHub Accounts/Repositories} section for a list of GitHub accounts and repositories relevant to pCT.  For a visual representation of this hierarchy, see the \autohyperlink[type=Section, label=pCT\_code Hierarchy Diagram]{pCT code Hierarchy Diagram}.
